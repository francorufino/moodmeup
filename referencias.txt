EXPLANATION ON WHY AND HOW:
To build an app that suggests happy music to users based on their mood, you can utilize the Spotify API to fetch tracks that are characterized by certain audio features associated with happiness. The key audio features you should focus on are valence, energy, and tempo, among others. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how you can identify and access these features using the Spotify API:

Key Audio Features for Happy Music
Valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g., happy, cheerful, euphoric).
Energy: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.
Tempo: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). Happy music often has a higher tempo.
Steps to Access and Use These Features
Obtain Access Token: Use your client credentials to obtain an access token, as you have already done in your script.

Search for Tracks or Playlists: Use the Spotify API to search for tracks or playlists. You can search for genres or specific keywords like "happy".

Get Audio Features: Use the Get Audio Features for a Track endpoint to retrieve audio features for each track. This endpoint will provide you with detailed information about the track, including valence, energy, and tempo.
